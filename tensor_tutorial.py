"""What is PyTorch?
================

It’s a Python-based scientific computing package targeted at two sets of
audiences:

-  A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs
-  a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility
   and speed

Getting Started
---------------

### Tensors

Tensors are similar to NumPy’s ndarrays, with the addition being that
Tensors can also be used on a GPU to accelerate computing.

  100+ Tensor operations, including transposing, indexing, slicing,
  mathematical operations, linear algebra, random numbers, etc.,
  are described here https://pytorch.org/docs/torch.

NumPy Bridge
------------

Converting a Torch Tensor to a NumPy array and vice versa is a breeze.

The Torch Tensor and NumPy array will share their underlying memory
locations (if the Torch Tensor is on CPU), and changing one will change
the other.

### Converting a Torch Tensor to a NumPy Array
"""

a = torch.ones(5)
print(a)

b = a.numpy()
print(b)

"""See how the numpy array changed in value."""

a.add_(1)
print(a)
print(b)

"""### Converting NumPy Array to Torch Tensor

See how changing the np array changed the Torch Tensor automatically
"""

import numpy as np

a = np.ones(5)
b = torch.from_numpy(a)
np.add(a, 1, out=a)
print(a)
print(b)

"""All the Tensors on the CPU except a CharTensor support converting to
NumPy and back.

CUDA Tensors
------------

Tensors can be moved onto any device using the ``.to`` method.
"""

# let us run this cell only if CUDA is available
# We will use `torch.device` objects to move tensors in and out of GPU
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")          # a CUDA device object
    y = torch.ones_like(x, device=device)  # directly create a tensor on GPU
    x = x.to(device)                       # or just use strings ``.to("cuda")``
    z = x + y
    print(z)
    print(z.to("cpu", torch.double))       # ``.to`` can also change dtype together!
